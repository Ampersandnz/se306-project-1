Comments on project brief:

Matt:
The project isn’t really swarm robotics, rather just a collection of robots that do certain tasks and have some level of communication. That being said, there isn’t really a reason robots could not multi task if a pressing need comes about. 

Famous last words, but I do not believe that a massive amount of programming is required for this project, it is more about the organisation / planning etc. On that vein, lots of structure planning (uml etc) should be good for code design. I’ve used MS project before to plan out tasks / work etc (cool GANNT charts hoo! - it’s available on Dreamspark for free). 

As for the robots, I have a few ideas regarding common logic, including navigation / priority systems but I feel that we should focus on project (time) plan first and get to that later

Feel free to add to this
